# WARS71
In our Software Development Lab, we had to make a game as a project. We chose to make a game which will uphold our Liberation War between Bangladesh and Pakistan in 1971.
It developed by Ahmed Al Wasi, Ahmadul Karim Chowdhury, Aurunave Mollik Ruddro, Md. Shirajus Salekin Shafi. We are from the CSE department, AUST, Integer 43 batch.
P.S. The word 'WARS' came from the first letter of our nicknames.
